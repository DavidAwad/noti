## Quick Walkthrough

The shortest usage of `noti` is this.

```
noti
```

That will display a banner notification that says "noti Done!".

### Banner notification

A more practical example could be compressing your huge music collection. You
don't want to sit and stare at your terminal while `tar` compresses all your
files. You also don't have to have to `alt+tab` back and forth to check if `tar`
is done. Instead, you can use `noti` to notify you when your music library is
compressed. You can relax and focus on that cat video.

```
noti tar -cjf music.tar.bz2 Music/
```

### Smartphone notification

Here's another situation where `noti` can help you save time. Imagine you're
working on a huge software project. Builds take 10s of minutes, not to mention
tests take more than 1 hour (true story). You don't want to sit at your computer
twiddling your thumbs. Maybe you should go play Ping Pong while you wait. You
can use `noti` to send you a Pushbullet notification when your project finishes
building.

```
export PUSHBULLET_ACCESS_TOKEN='abc123'
noti -p ./build.sh
```

## More Examples

Display a notification when `apt-get` finishes updating on a remote server.

```
noti ssh you@server.com apt-get update
```

You can also add `noti` after a command, in case you forgot at the beginning.

```
clang foo.c -Wall -lm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -o bizz; noti
```

Create a reminder to get back to a friend.

```
noti -t "Reply to Pedro" gsleep 5m &
```

Have your Mac tell you what happened. This will speak "docker pull done".

```
noti -V zarvox docker pull ubuntu
```

Make Zarvox the default notification type. This will speak "brew update done".

```
noti -V zarvox -S
noti brew update
```
